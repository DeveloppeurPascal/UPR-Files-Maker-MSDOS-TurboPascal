# UPR Files Maker - Turbo Pascal - MS-Dos - 1991

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

Nowadays, we use base-64 encoding when we want to switch from binary files to a transferable or printable text format.

The Internet as we know it didn't exist when I coded All2Upr and Upr2All. The problem was rather to print a file that couldn't be printed, and to be able to restore it elsewhere after re-typing. That's why this project exists, and it's clearly obsolete.

This project has been created with [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) in 1991.

It's possible that this program is compilable with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) but I haven't tried. Units not supplied can be found in the [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies-TurboPascal) repository. If any are missing, please let me know so that I can add them.

You'll find the binaries (8 bits) in the “release” folder. This is the September 19, 1993 version. You can only run it on an MS-Dos emulator, Windows 3.x or 95. There's no point in trying it on Windows beyond these versions.
